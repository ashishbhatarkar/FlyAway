# FlyAway

Flyaway.com was a Java-based web application that enabled users to search and book flights. The key features included:

A search form on the homepage to enter travel details like date, source and destination.
Display of available flights with ticket prices based on the entered travel details.
Personal details registration page and a dummy payment gateway for booking and payment.
A confirmation page with booking details upon successful payment.
Admin login page to change the password after login.
Master list of places for source and destination, master list of airlines, and list of flights with details of source, destination, airline, and ticket price.
The application was developed using Eclipse, Java, JSP, MYSQL, Git/GitHub, and Scrum agile framework. Data structures such as search and sort techniques were used to optimize the source code and increase performance.
